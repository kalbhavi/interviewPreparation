METHOD 2 (Use Sorting)
In general, Merge Sort is the best suited sorting algorithm for sorting linked lists efficiently.
1)	Sort the elements using Merge Sort. We will soon be writing a post about sorting a linked list. O(nLogn)
2)	Remove duplicates in linear time using the algorithm for removing duplicates in sorted Linked List. O(n)

Please note that this method doesnâ€™t preserve the original order of elements.

Time Complexity: O(nLogn)



METHOD 3 (Use Hashing)
We traverse the link list from head to end. For every newly encountered element, we check whether it is in the hash table: if yes, we remove it; otherwise we put it in the hash table.

Thanks to bearwang for suggesting this method.

Time Complexity: O(n) on average (assuming that hash table access time is O(1) on average).
